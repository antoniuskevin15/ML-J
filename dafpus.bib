However, the idea of a computer learning some abstract concept from data and applying them to yet unseen situations is not new and has been around at least since the 1950s. Many of these basic principles are very familiar to the pharmacometrics and clinical pharmacology community. In this paper, we want to introduce the foundational ideas of ML to this community such that readers obtain the essential tools they need to understand publications on the topic. Although we will not go into the very details and theoretical background, we aim to point readers to relevant literature and put applications of ML in molecular biology as well as the fields of pharmacometrics and clinical pharmacology into perspective.},

   abstract = {The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic is touching every facet of human lives (e.g., public health, education, economy, transportation, and the environment). This novel pandemic and non-pharmaceutical interventions of lockdown and confinement implemented citywide, regionally or nationally are affecting virus transmission, people's travel patterns, and air quality. Many studies have been conducted to predict the diffusion of the COVID-19 disease, assess the impacts of the pandemic on human mobility and on air quality, and assess the impacts of lockdown measures on viral spread with a range of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This literature review aims to analyze the results from past research to understand the interactions among the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown measures, human mobility, and air quality. The critical review of prior studies indicates that urban form, people's socioeconomic and physical conditions, social cohesion, and social distancing measures significantly affect human mobility and COVID-19 viral transmission. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are inclined to use private transportation for necessary travel to mitigate coronavirus-related health problems. This review study also noticed that COVID-19 related lockdown measures significantly improve air quality by reducing the concentration of air pollutants, which in turn improves the COVID-19 situation by reducing respiratory-related sickness and deaths. It is argued that ML is a powerful, effective, and robust analytic paradigm to handle complex and wicked problems such as a global pandemic. This study also explores the spatio-temporal aspects of lockdown and confinement measures on coronavirus diffusion, human mobility, and air quality. Additionally, we discuss policy implications, which will be helpful for policy makers to take prompt actions to moderate the severity of the pandemic and improve urban environments by adopting data-driven analytic methods.},

   abstract = {Digital proxies of human mobility and physical mixing have been used to monitor viral transmissibility and effectiveness of social distancing interventions in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We develop a new framework that parameterizes disease transmission models with age-specific digital mobility data. By fitting the model to case data in Hong Kong, we are able to accurately track the local effective reproduction number of COVID-19 in near real time (i.e., no longer constrained by the delay of around 9 days between infection and reporting of cases) which is essential for quick assessment of the effectiveness of interventions on reducing transmissibility. Our findings show that accurate nowcast and forecast of COVID-19 epidemics can be obtained by integrating valid digital proxies of physical mixing into conventional epidemic models. Digital proxies of human mobility can be used to monitor social distancing, and therefore have potential to infer COVID-19 dynamics. Here, the authors integrate travel card data from Hong Kong into a transmission model and show that it can be used to track transmissibility in near real-time.},

   abstract = {Water is one of the main elements of the environment, which determines the existence of life on the earth such as humans, aquatic animals, and plants. In order to control the water quality environment more efficiently and intelligently, numerous water quality models have been developed for predicting and evaluating water quality accurately and intelligently. In order to control the water quality environment more effectively and intelligently, artificial neural network (ANN) and the hybrid models that contain it are applied to accurately and intelligently predict and evaluate water quality, improving the reliability and assessment capabilities of water quality prediction. Therefore, this paper is a literature review aimed at analysing and comparing the characteristics and applications of existing artificial neural network models. According to the direction of information transmission in the network, we divide them into feed-forward networks and recurrent networks. In addition, we compare the pros and cons of each model. Our analysis provides guidance for model improvement in future research. Moreover, these models can be applied to aquaculture in the future to promote their development. 1. Introduction Water is one of the main elements of the environment which determine the existence of life on the earth, such as humans, aquatic animals and plants. However, the amount of wastewater from industrial, agricultural and domestic sewage is increasing sharply every year, and rivers are so polluted that water quality monitoring and management are imminent. At present, water quality problems mainly include maintaining oxygen levels, eutrophication (excessive growth of algae caused by excessive nitrogen and phosphorus in water), pH and heavy metal pollution. In response to these problems, the water quality models simulate the migration and transformation process of pollutants, identify the temporal and spatial distribution of pollutants and water quality parameters, and provide powerful technical and methodological support for water quality prediction, management and planning decisions. Therefore, establishing a water quality model is the most important task in solving water quality problems.},

   abstract = {Dust accumulation on the photovoltaic system adversely degrades its power conversion efficiency (PCE). Focusing on residential installations, dust accumulation on PV modules installed in tropical regions may be vulnerable due to lower inclination angles and rainfall that encourage dust settlement on PV surfaces. However, most related studies in the tropics are concerned with studies in the laboratory, where dust collection is not from the actual field, and an accurate performance prediction model is impossible to obtain. This paper investigates the dust-related degradation in the PV output performance based on the developed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) predictive model. For this purpose, two identical monocrystalline modules of 120 Wp were tested and assessed under real operating conditions in Melaka, Malaysia (2.1896° N, 102.2501° E), of which one module was dust-free (clean). At the same time, the other was left uncleaned (dusty) for one month. The experimental datasets were divided into three sets: the first set was used for training and testing purposes, while the second and third, namely Data 2 and Data 3, were used for validating the proposed ANN model. The accuracy study shows that the predicted data using the ANN model and the experimentally acquired data are in good agreement, with MAE and RMSE for the cleaned PV module are as low as 1.28 °C, and 1.96 °C respectively for Data 2 and 3.93 °C and 4.92 °C respectively for Data 3.  Meanwhile, the RMSE and MAE for the dusty PV module are 1.53°C and 2.82 °C respectively for Data 2 and 4.13 °C and 5.26 °C for Data 3. The ANN predictive model was then used for yield forecasting in a residential installation and found that the clean PV system provides a 7.29\% higher yield than a dusty system. The proposed ANN model is beneficial for PV system installers to assess and anticipate the impacts of dust on the PV installation in cities with similar climatic conditions.},

   abstract = {Detection and prediction of the novel Coronavirus present new challenges for the medical research community due to its widespread across the globe. Methods driven by Artificial Intelligence can help predict specific parameters, hazards, and outcomes of such a pandemic. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have proven a novel opportunity to determine various difficulties in prediction. In this work, two learning algorithms, namely deep learning and reinforcement learning, were developed to forecast COVID-19. This article constructs a model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), particularly the Modified Long Short-Term Memory (MLSTM) model, to forecast the count of newly affected individuals, losses, and cures in the following few days. This study also suggests deep learning reinforcement to optimize COVID-19's predictive outcome based on symptoms. Real-world data was utilized to analyze the success of the suggested system. The findings show that the established approach promises prognosticating outcomes concerning the current COVID-19 pandemic and outperformed the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and the Machine Learning model, Logistic Regresion (LR) in terms of error rate.},

   abstract = {Millions of people have been infected worldwide in the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we aim to propose fourteen prediction models based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the COVID-19 outbreak for policy makers. The ANN-based models were utilized to estimate the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China, Japan, Singapore, Iran, Italy, South Africa and United States of America. These models exploit historical records of confirmed cases, while their main difference is the number of days that they assume to have impact on the estimation process. The COVID-19 data were divided into a train part and a test part. The former was used to train the ANN models, while the latter was utilized to compare the&nbsp;purposes. The data analysis shows not only significant fluctuations in the daily confirmed cases but also different ranges of total confirmed cases observed in the time interval considered. Based on the obtained results, the ANN-based model that takes into account the previous 14 days outperforms the&nbsp;other ones. This comparison reveals the importance of considering the maximum incubation period in predicting the COVID-19 outbreak. Comparing the ranges of determination coefficients indicates that the estimated results for Italy are the best one. Moreover, the predicted results for Iran achieved the ranges of [0.09, 0.15] and [0.21, 0.36] for the mean absolute relative errors and normalized root mean square errors, respectively, which were the best ranges obtained for these criteria among different countries. Based on the achieved results, the ANN-based model that takes into account the previous fourteen days for prediction is suggested to predict daily confirmed cases, particularly in countries that have experienced the first peak of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study has&nbsp;not only proved the applicability of ANN-based model for prediction of the COVID-19 outbreak, but also showed that considering incubation period of SARS-COV-2 in prediction models may generate more accurate estimations.},
